### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

When completing the assignment, I did find the labs to be an very helpful as it was very closely related to the assignment. One of the best examples of this would be the search bar function that was necessary for the weekly assignment. Once the gif lab was complete, you really have most of the tools need to get the weekly assignment rolling. The one part of the lab that was need in the weekly assignment but not provided through the lab was the way to show all the gifs and/or movies before anything was searched. Luckily, you could have used the resources given in the lab to infer how to do that in the weekly assignment.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would have tried to do the strech features, specifically the the feature that allows the user to view the description of the movie when they either click on the image of the movie or hover over it. I would also try to find a way to have the site refresh the search results each time a new character was added to the form and refresh on it's own when there was nothing in the search box.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

In this demo I think the front-end portion of the project went well and my understand of front-end got better as a result. When looking back I wish I would have taken the time to understand ALL the steps in every lab as it would have saved me a lot of time building my week 1 project. I noticed that I lot of my peers were asking quetsions throughout the duration of the lab and showed through the work that they present during the demo that asking those questions paid off. With that being said I want to make sure I am asking a lot of questions during the coming weeks as it will not only help the overall quality of my work but as better my understanding of my newfound knowledge.

### Shout out

I would like to give a shout out to my day two and four group (Henry, Rodrigo, Jungah and Robert) as they were amazing resources to ask questions! I would also like to shoutout Matt for breaking down sometimes hard concepts into digestible sections that made me feel like I could understand the material.
